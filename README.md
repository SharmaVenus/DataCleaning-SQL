DATA CLEANING WITH SQL 

Data cleaning is an essential step in any data analysis project. It involves identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data. Data cleaning can improve the quality and reliability of the data, as well as make it easier to explore and manipulate.

**Project Details**
Nashville is one of the fastest-growing cities in the US, attracting many people and businesses with its vibrant culture and economy. The housing market in Nashville is also booming, with high demand and rising prices. However, to analyze and understand the trends and patterns in the housing data, it is important to have clean and reliable data.

In this project, I will use SQL to perform various data cleaning tasks on a dataset of Nashville housing transactions. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains information such as property address, sale date, sale price, land use, and legal reference. 
However, the dataset also has some data quality issues, such as:
Inconsistent or incorrect date formats, Null or missing values, Duplicate records, Unnecessary or irrelevant columns Types or spelling errors, Outliers or extreme values.

I used SQL skills such as joins, subqueries, temp tables, CTEs, window functions, aggregate functions, and more to clean and transform the data. I also used some built-in SQL functions and tools that can help you with data cleaning, such as SUBSTRING, REPLACE, CONVERT, Parsename, CHARINDEX, and more.


**Tools used**
